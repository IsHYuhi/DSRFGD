### Requirements
* Python 3.8
* PyTorch 1.8
* TorchVision 0.9

### Preparation
1. Download text and figure data from [DDI-100](https://github.com/machine-intelligence-laboratory/DDI-100/tree/master/dataset), and put "English" data under ```data/EN/```. (e. g. ```02, 06, 10, 13, 16, 20, 25, 32, 33```)
    * In the future, we will release a code that does not require data containing location information, such as DDI-100.

2. Download textures and background data from some website, and put it under ```data/textures/``` and ```data/backgrounds/```, respectively.

3. Download shadows rendered in Blender from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X1R1RKDFa803EVgc1i1J7vulsRAulZ8O/view?usp=sharing).

Dir structure is
```
-data
    -EN
    -textures
    -backgrounds
    -shadows
```
